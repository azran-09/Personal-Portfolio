            <h1> Introduction to Azul</h1>
            <p>
                Hello! My full name is Azul Fernanda Rangel, and I am a first year at Yale College. I intend to major
                in Computer Science and recieve certificates in Computing, Culture, and Society as well as 
                Human Rights. I am originally based in Everett, WA but currently reside in New Haven, CT 
                in order to complete my Bachelor's in Computer Science.
            </p>
            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I have experience in coding with <em> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Python, and recently Racket! </em>
                    I am still actively developing my skills with each of these languages, including being a part of
                    the Yale Computer Society's, also known as y/cs, Catalyst Program. Through this program, I am
                    learning how to use <em> Vite, React, and Github </em>in order to set myself up for success in the industry.</li>
                <li>I am also currently involved with CodeHaven and SheCode at Yale, where I work as a tutor elementary schoolers at 
                    CodeHaven, and Middle School girls at SheCode, all with the goal of spreading my love of Computer Science and 
                    to demonstrate that anyone can become a Computer Scientist.
                </li>
                <li>I am interested in how AI will shape education and how Computer Scientists can ensure it plays a positive role that emphasizes high level Critical Thinking.</li>
                <li> In addition, I hope to work as a Software Engineer working to make programs that serve a greater purpose, such as
                    combating houselessness, food insecurity, or spreading quality education to anyone, anywhere.</li>
                <li>In my free time, I love to play soccer and spend quality time with friends and family!</li>
